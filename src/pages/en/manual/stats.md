# Stats

To see the stats obtained in the single player modes, you have to click in the user icon in the top right part of the screen.  
It will appear the following:

![Estad√≠sticas](/kekris/manual/stats.png)

Here will appear the stats of the three singleplayer game modes. It will show the last result obtained in a completed or won game (in the case of 40 liner and blitz) and the five best results. If the last result is between those five that result will have a blue background instead of gray.

## Change username

From this screen will also be possible change the user name. It is neccesary to mention that this won't create a different profile with different controls and statistics. It will only show a different name in multiplayer mode.
In the top left part of the screen, the user name will be shown next to a pencil icon. If you hover the mouse, the username will scale a little bit. If you click it, a dialog will appear where the current username will appear in a text field. You can change it from here, not being allowed to leave it empty or longer than 50 characters.
